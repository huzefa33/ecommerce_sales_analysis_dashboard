Project Overview:
Designed and developed an interactive and executive-level ecommerce sales dashboard to track key performance indicators (KPIs), visualize trends, and support data-driven decision-making for business growth.

Key Contributions & Insights:

1. Sales Growth Analysis: Identified a 20.62% Year-over-Year (YoY) increase in total sales, 28.64% growth in orders, and 27.45% rise in quantity sold, highlighting strong market expansion.

2. Profit Margin Observation: Uncovered a 5.15% decline in profit margin, despite increased revenue—triggering further exploration of cost structure and discounting policies.

3. Category Performance: Pinpointed Technology as the highest contributor with $145.45K profit, while identifying Phones as a high-loss sub-category (-$328.46K), enabling actionable product-level insights.

4. Geo & Trend Visualization: Used geo-mapping and time series visualizations to identify high-performing states (total sales up to $2.29M) and seasonal spikes in Q4 (Nov–Dec).

5. Visual Tools & Interactivity: Incorporated slicers and filters (Region, Year, Segment) and custom visualizations (donut charts, bar charts, trend lines) to allow users to drill down into the data across dimensions.

Impact:
This dashboard provided valuable insights to stakeholders, enabling them to focus on profitable segments, optimize underperforming categories, and realign marketing strategies by geography and season.
